Card Command Library for Maple

The goal of this library is to provide an feature set of commands specific to
each card type. Thereby, a user can implement (at a minimum) read and writes
to a card's registers.

Most of the work done to date has been to set up a C rountine API for users to 
initialize their own cards and interface with the SDIO peripheral. 
Alongside this delevopment, the C++ library has tried to draw new users in with
clean examples of how to work with the C API as well as provide common
functions for getting started.
Thus far, the status of this library is to idenitfy a card and read it's 
card specific registers.
This is known as the card initialization and identification process, and it is
almost complete. The init() function provides this process.

Next steps in the library, are to send and receive blocks of data from the 
card.
This functionality will be available in read() and write() calls in weeks to 
come.
