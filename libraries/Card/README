Card Command Library for Maple

The goal of this library is to provide an feature set of commands specific to
each card type. Thereby, a user can implement (at a minimum) read and writes
to a card's registers.

We begin with a Secure Digital card command set as this library is being
developed alongside the sdio hardware peripheral.
